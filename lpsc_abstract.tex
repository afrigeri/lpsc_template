There used to be a \LaTeX\ template and a style file for writing
LPSC abstracts available on the LPSC Web site.  However, in the
last couple of years, no such template has been available, and we
found ourselves dragging the old one out.  It was full of scary \TeX\
commands and had a date from 1996 in it, so we decided to start from
scratch and write a template based on \LaTeX's own article class and 
a short \LaTeXe\ package file.  Most of the \LaTeX\ work is based on
\citet{latexguide}.

Fortunately, the requirements for LPSC abstracts \citep{LPSC} are
reasonably relaxed.

\subsubsection*{Title area}

The title mechanism for this template is a simple command,
\verb=\titlearea=, which takes two arguments, the title text and the
author info text.

The title text is made a font size bigger and made boldface in the
lpscabs package.  If you would like it styled differently, it should
be easy to go in to the \texttt{lpscabs.sty} file and change it.

The old style file had a fancy automatic mechanism for entering
authors and putting superscripted numbers on their names to match
up with their affiliations later on in the title.  We contemplated
doing that and then realized that maybe authors would like some
other mechanism besides numbers, maybe little letters, or any of
the special characters like \dag\ or \ddag\ to mark their affiliations,
or maybe all of the authors are from the same place, so no little
super-scripted characters are needed.  Possibly some authors could
have more than one affiliation.  So rather than try to program
something that can be all things to all people, we'll just let you
(the authors) do whatever you like to the text in that line, you're
smart people.  It is a little less convenient, but we think it is more
flexible.  We have commented out a few multiple author styles up
near that section of this source file.

\subsubsection*{Running title}

If your abstract is two pages, and you'd like to have a snappy little
header on the second page, then you can use the \verb=\runningtitle=
command to supply text that will be written there.

\subsubsection*{Section styles}

In general, people try to put lots of information into their LPSC
abstracts, and want to minimize the space being taken up by section
headers.  You could redefine the sectioning commands to change their
styling if you like, or you could just use the \verb=\subsubsection*=
command (as we have done in this example), and
you could even use the \verb=\paragraph= command if you wanted the
section's title on the same line as the first sentence of the
section, saving even more space.  You can also use the \texttt{titlesec}
package with the \texttt{small} and \texttt{compact} options to further
compress the font size and space around titles.


\subsubsection*{Figures}

Good figures are hard to make, there's no question about it.  That
goes double for deciding which figures to include in your 
space-limited abstract.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{lb_fig1.png}
\caption[Color Scales and Color-Deficient-Viewer Simulations]{
    \label{color_scales}
    This is Figure 1 from \citet{2004EOSTr..85..385L}.  
    }
\end{center}
\end{figure}

When you make the decision to create a color figure, take some time
to think about the colors that you use.  We think that
\citet{2004EOSTr..85..385L} make a good case for not using the
typical rainbow-spectrum color scheme (e.g. Fig.~\ref{color_scales}).
Just because you decide to use color doesn't mean that you need to
use \emph{all} of the colors.  Don't confuse ``pretty'' with
``meaningful.''

If you need figures or tables to be the full width of the page,
just use their starred versions, like \verb=\begin{figure*}= instead
of \verb=\begin{figure}=.

\subsubsection*{Works that you reference}

Using \texttt{natbib} with the \texttt{numbers} option and the
\texttt{unsrtnat} bibliographystyle approximates the reference-style
that has emerged for LPSC abstracts over the years, but there is
no hard and fast rule.  You may think that the references take up
too much vertical space (with each reference starting a new line).
You can use the \texttt{paralist} package and enclose the bibliography
stuff in a \texttt{inparaenum} environment.  Examples of how to do
this are commented out in this source file.  However, if you really
have that many references maybe you should be submitting this to a
peer-reviewed journal and not just a conference.

%\begin{inparaenum}
\bibliography{bibliography}
\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}
%\end{inparaenum}
