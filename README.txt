This is a LaTeX 2e version of the of a LaTeX template for LPSC.
This directory contains example files and some of the original files
distributed by the LPI.  The template file uses several pacakages,
but most LaTeX distributions should have these packages already.

Details about how to use the template can be found in the text of
the template file.  There is both a PNG and EPS version of the
figure depending on if you use pdflatex or latex, dvips, and ps2pdf.

Files:

Makefile                example GNU make file for use with the latex-mk system, optional
bibliography.bib        Sample bibliography file
lb_fig1.eps				Sample figure, EPS format
lb_fig1.png				Sample figure, PNG format
lpsc_abstract.tex		The template file.  Modify this with your own abstract.
lpscabs.sty				The package file for setting things up, no modifications needed.


    WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!

DISCLAIMER:  These files are in no way sanctioned or blessed by the
LPI.  We created it to make our own lives easier, and figured that
other folks might benefit from it.  This template is no substitute
for reading the appropriate style and formatting guides provided
by the LPI, as they are subject to change.  Don't blame us if the
LPI complains about your format (or rejects your abstract).


Now, get back to work and write that abstract!
